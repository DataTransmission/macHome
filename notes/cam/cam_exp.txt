1. cam_only_aquaplanet_test
  # Purpose : Test if the subgrid fields could be nudged back by the
  # prognostic field replaced every 3 hours. 
  # Exp : run simulations for 20 days until spin-up, and start the
  # control simulation for  5 days and save restart every 3 hours.
  # Then repeat the experiment starting at the 20th day by removing
  # all the fields except U, V, Q, T, PS, PHI, CLOUD, CLDICE, CLDLIQ,
  # NUMICE, NUMLIQ, PBLH, TKE, TPERT.

  # Purpose : Treate SPCAM full fields as the truth and rerun CAM
  # using the restart every timestep (30 mins).
  # Exp : run
