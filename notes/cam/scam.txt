Run SCAM:
1. find out the iop (forcing file) of RCE 
2. find out the initial field from "run-scam.csh"

Don't Run SCAM (don't bother the IOP thing):
1. find the input variables X and Y of the rhs Q1(X) and Q2(Y) of CAM
2. Plug in X(t_i) and Y(t_i) and compare with the instantaneous tendency output of SAM Q1(X(t_i)), Q2(Y(t_i))
3. From Yanai73, the rhs for Q1 consists of "condensative" and "evaporative" tendencies, FIND IT!
4. Find the modules/subroutines before physics_update() since we want to calculate the instananeous tendency "ptend" & "tend", not the updated "states"
5. Is the "physics_ptend_sum","ptend" or "tend" what I want?
6. check for where (subroutines) ptend, tend, and physics_ptend_sum are updated




Better modify the Inputdata for IOP in:
/glade/p/cesmdata/cseg/inputdata/atm/cam/inic/gaus/cami_0000-01-01_64x128_L30_c090102.nc
