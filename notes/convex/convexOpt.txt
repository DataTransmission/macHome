functions that preserve convexity:
Affine function: f(x) = Ax + b

Perspective function: P: \R^n -> \R^n-1, P(x,t) = x/t, 
		where domain is x \in \R^n-1, t \in \R++
		therefore domain is \R^n-1\X\R++, 
		domP = {(x,t)|t>0} is the domain constraint
	example: x = [1 2 3], t = [4], therefore domP = [1 2 3 4]
		=> imP = [1/4 2/4 3/4], this P preserves convexity


Techniques to find convexity of a set S:

	1) substitute 日x1+(1-日)x2, determine if the condition for S holds
	2) find a line intersection with S, S is convex iff the intersection with a line is convex.
		(remember quadratic inequality)
	3) decompose S into halfspaces and hyperplanes, which are all convex sets.

Kinds of convex sets:
	) the set of points closer to a point than the other point.
	) the set {x | x + S2 \subset S1 } where S1,S2 \subset \R^n, and S1 convex.
	) the set {x | ||x-a|| <= 日||x-b||}, a \neq b and 0<=日<=1. (ball ||x-xc||<=r)
	) conic hull of an outer product.
	) expanded and restricted set.
	) sets of probablity distributions
