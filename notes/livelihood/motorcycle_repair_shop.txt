American Motorcycle (American Rider rental)
  $65 an hour labor at American Motorcycle just off 27th Ave has been a great experience for me. 
  I had to have them install a part and they charged me $30 and did not round to the nearest hour. 
  The Suzuki store near the airport wanted $200 to do the same job.

Cycle-Race-Tek
  Ray at Cycle-Race-Tek. We both have sport bikes. Ray is an excellent mechanic and pretty fair with his prices. 
  I was extremely happy considering the amount of work I needed done. ...

Ride Studios ***
  It is not cheap, but the guys at Ride Studios up by Jackson Memorial Hospital are fantastic.  
  Extremely professional and as a gear head, their service floor was making me drool.

Palmetto Motorsports and Riva Motorsports 
  Riva Motorsports is good, but way down south, and Palmetto motorports is fine too, but they are up in Miami Lakes.  
  I have experience only with Riva, but have heard good things about Palmetto, 
  I would probably choose whichever you are closest too, and ask for an estimate ahead of time.
