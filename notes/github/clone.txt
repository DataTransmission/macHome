CLONE REPO
----------
# clone a "forked" gitRepoDir to local localRepoDir (fork happens when you go to that person's 
# repo and click on the fork repo, it does not allow you to push to their repo unless you are a contributer.
# So everything that are pushed are to your own remote repo)
$ git clone gitRepoDir localRepoDir
