\subsection{Introduction}
Due to subgrid-scale uncertainties and numerical errors, the kinetic energy spectra for the climate and weather models do not reproduce the observed $k^{-5/3}$ in the inertial-range {\cite{Nastrom85}} and drops off too steep for wavelengths less than $400$km. 

% Truncation of the subgrid-scale flow removes the interaction between scales and renders the missing of the upscale kinetic energy transport.
% Excessive dissipation further results in the erroneous resolved flow in terms of the kinetic energy spectra.
% SKEB does two things, physically and numerically 
% 1) backscatter the uniformly (in space) missing upscale KE dynamics during turbulence dissipation (physical) at the intermediate scale (find the functional dependence of streamfunction and turbulence Re=UL/\nu) (is it more important to add to places with more turbulence, stronger shear zone (related to gravity wave and deep convection associated to (2)) ?) 
% 2) add back the energy affected by erroneous dissipation (gravity wave drag, deep convection, interpolation) at specific caluculated regions (is the add-back scale important?).

The stochatic kinetic energy backscatter of the subgrid fluctuations transfers energy upscale to the resolved flow, which is an idea originated from the large-eddy simulation using dynamical subgrid parameterization based on eddy-damped quasi-normal Markoviean, direct-interaction approximation closure model, and Markov model for the subgrid scale {\cite{Frederiksen97, Frederiksen06}}.

By injecting the missing subgrid kinetic energy especially to the regions of erroneous dissipation caused by deep convection, numerical interpolation, gravity wave drag, etc.
