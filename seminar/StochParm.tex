		based on the reliable forecast skill shown in \citet{Arnold13}.\
		Therefore, the additive stochastic parameterization for $\bold{U^*}$ is 
		\begin{equation} \label{stochParm}
			U_p = \bar{U} + e^k.\
		\end{equation}

%		despite a variety of stochastic parameterizations
%		(e.g., state dependent noise, multiplicative noise, etc).\
		
		The time series of $r^k$ in $\tau_z=2$ exhibits a high autocorrelation (Figure {\ref{autocorr}} (a)), 
		so it is reasonable to model $r^k$ as a $1^{st}$-order autoregressive process 
		(AR1) {\citep{Wilks11}}, where the discrete time samples of $e^k$ could be represented
		as a simple linear regression
		\begin{equation} \label{AR1}
			\begin{aligned}
			e^{k+1}
			& = \gamma e^k + \epsilon  \\
%			& = \gamma e^k + \sigma_\epsilon z \\
			& = \gamma e^k + (1-\gamma^2)^{1/2} \sigma_r z
			\end{aligned}
		\end{equation}
		where the predictand $e^{k+1}$ is updated by the predictor $e^k$ at the previous time sample,
		$\gamma$ is the 1-lag autocorrelation coefficient from the true residual, 
		and $\epsilon$ is the error of the simple regression.\
		Figure {\ref{linearCurve}} (c) and (d) shows a higher
		density near the deterministic curve and weakens away.\
		Therefore $\epsilon$ is modeled as a
		centered Gaussian process, 
		with a standard normal random variable $z$,
		and the standard deviation $\sigma_r$ of the true residuals.\
		The ensemble forecast of the additive stochastic parameterization 
		contains a total of 40 ensemble members for any event.\

		
		It is intuitive to represent the subgrid-scale 
		uncertainties with a time-varying $e^k$ since $r^k$ is constantly changing,
		but, there is no theoretical proof that a time-fixed $e$ is invalid.\
		This leads to the perturbed parameter scheme where 
		$e$ is fixed in time, which is no longer a stochastic process.\
