The goal of this study is to develop a reliable and efficient perturbed parameter scheme
that is comparable to stochastic parameterizations.\ 
The Lorenz model is a simple testbed for numerical simulations.\
We have implemented a two time-scale Lorenz 63 (L63) model
to mimic the ocean-atmosphere coupled system, and 
a spatially-resolved convective-scale Lorenz 96 (L96) model 
coupled to the L63 atmospheric component.\
The full set of equations is defined as the ``truth".\
The spatially-resolved system will be parameterized 
by three different schemes: (i) deterministic, (ii) additive stochastic parameterization, and (iii) perturbed parameter.\
Perfect initial conditions are applied to investigate model error.\
By applying ``informative" probability distributions to the perturbed parameter scheme,
we have reduced systematic biases where previous implementations have failed to do so.\
Despite the fact that stochastic parameterizations are shown to resolve systematic errors,
they become computationally expensive in a GCM with 
more grid points to generate correlated stochasticity.\ 
The proposed scheme uses a stochastic spectral method,
Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE),
to approximate the exact ensemble states with minimum model simulations.\
Once built, PCE is implemented as a low cost sampling 
surrogate to generate large ensemble forecasts without actually integrating the model.\
The PCE-accelerated informative perturbed parameter scheme
generates competitive and reliable ensemble forecasts.\
